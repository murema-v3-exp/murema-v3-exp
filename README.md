# Hi, I'm Murema Manganyi! 👋

As a Computer Science and Applied Statistics student, I aim to harness technology, my programming skills, and my data analysis to take over the world (or at least improve it a bit). I’m passionate about software development and data analysis, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.
